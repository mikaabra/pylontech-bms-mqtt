using same model waveshare esp32-s3 as in ../esphome/ project
use that yaml file for inspiration
smartshunt ve-direct connected to IO4 via voltage divider
replaces old esp8266 being ve-direct to mqtt bridge
old esp8266 config yaml file in current directory 
also should replace rs485 dongle connected to evever mppt (home assistant config in current dir).
this new esp32 should replace both the rs485 polling that Home Assistant does now via dongle, plus the esp8266 (ve direct -> mqtt)
no need for mqtt topic backwards compatibility. I would rather start fresh (greenfield) and do it right, with HA discovery topics etc.
venv exists in ~/src/esphome-venv
